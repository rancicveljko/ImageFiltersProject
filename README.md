# Image Filters Project
This is an academic project showing examples of how to process images.
The app's features include: applying different filters directly onto a bitmap using matrix arithmetic, isolating and changing color models, and creating image histograms.
The app is made with Windows Forms, using .NET's System.Drawing library as the image-processing API.
